Corewar-JS
==========

Project Goals
-------------
* To create a web based redcode parser and Memory Array Redcode Simulator (MARS)
* Use node.js to reuse client code on the server. A client side runtime allows for users to test their warriors, and server side runtime to run verified competitons.
* Use the Ajax.org Code Editor (ACE) formerly known as bespin.
* Use canvas to create live (but replayable) visualization 
* Allow advanced debugging and provide easy to understand error messages
* Provide ELO rankings for warriers and/or coders.
* Provide platform for coders to discuss their core war related activities and communicate with other community members.
* Provide easy access to core war tutorials and references
* Provide introductory core war walk through

Development Goals
-----------------
* Literate programming
* Extensive Unit Testing
* Continuous integration and staging server allowing full access to all contributers

Technologies

* Node.js
* Jison (JS parser generator inspired by bison)
* Express (Node.js web framework)
* Mongoose (ORM)
* Jade (Node.js template engine)
* Ajax.org Code Editor (ACE) formerly known as bespin.
